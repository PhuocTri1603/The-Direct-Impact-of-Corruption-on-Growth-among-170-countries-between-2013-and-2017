# The-Direct-Impact-of-Corruption-on-Growth-among-170-countries-between-2013-and-2017
This study tries to examine the direct impact of corruption on growth of 170 countries on the average in the 2013-2017 period. Several descriptive statistic results depict that the relationship of corruption and growth is negative for low income countries. There could exist the positive correlation between corruption and growth in case of higher income group, however the anxious effects of initial GDP might overwhelm corruption impacts. Both ordinary least square (OLS) technique and two- stages least square (2SLS) technique are used to address this relationship. In consistency with the findings of the previous empirical evidence, regression results illustrate that the direct pessimistic impact of corruption on growth in all nations.
